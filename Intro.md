# Hohenlohe Lab Code Review

### Goals
- Share best practices, tricks, resources
- Build a relationship with someone in the lab who can help you figure things out and find bugs

### Reflection points
- How did you learn to code?
- How do you get help?
- What biases do you have going into review?
- What standards should we try to meet in our field?

### Let's try it
1. Take turns walking your parter/group through  code in ~5 min. Take notes if you're not presenting.
When presenting note for your reviewer(s):
  - What is the code trying to do?
  - What could be improved in the process?
  - What are the inputs?
2. Review!
  - Is the code sufficiently annotated?
  - Reproducible? Efficient? Clean? Fast?
  - Could existing libraries perform tasks?
  - What vulnerabilities to edge cases exist?
  - What chunks could you use in your own code?
3. Read & Respond to reviews
